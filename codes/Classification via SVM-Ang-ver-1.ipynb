quite confusing.\n","TBH I am glad there is an effort to centralize these services so I don't want to complain to much, but my main issue is with the overall usability of myslice. It can be hard to navigate and find stuff, and I know it's \"my slice\" but some variation in colors (maybe by function) would be really helpful \n","The panels are great in MySLice but when I try to click on the panel where I approve student time will log me out. The work around click on another tile 1st then click on the tile to approve the timesheet. Also, I don't like that I need to go to MySlice for the directory that used to be online. We have external constituents that need to contact us and now they don't have a way to find us in the directory. Staff and faculty are also not updating the directory with their extension or number to contact in MySlice - many people cannot be found in the directory making it difficult to contact them if they don't respond to email. \n","Agree to Disagree errors: 3\n","Constantly getting timed out is frustrating as is switching from the Myslice student home page to the employee home page every time I sign on. The search function is good as there are a couple of things I can't figure out where they live.  Credit card reconciliation is nice that its all online and has a work flow but completing the form takes so much longer. Perhaps its a connectivity problem that I have to wait for every field of a chart string line.  At least in JPMC I could have a list of favorite chart string to choose from that would immediately populate the form.  I know ITS assists with Blackboard but as for Myslice I didn't know about help or support.  The role out of the new Myslice was terrible. Some prior communication could has softened the transition some (maybe).\n","Cumbersome, confusing, not user friendly, hard to find what I need, archaic \n","As someone who prides themselves on being tech savvy, MySlice is not easy to navigate. I appreciate that, in some ways, the system allows for a lot of resources to be accessible through the MySlice channel, but MySlice is convoluted, slow, and unreliable.\n","Training modules/sessions that are easily accessible would be helpful.\n","Timeclock in myslice seems like an EOL software. Coming from my other job, there are a lot better systems out there for employee time tracking and payroll. It seems almost archaic as the GUI can be coded by any first-semester computer science student.\n","I never receive communications regarding updates to MySlice\n","Disagree to Agree errors:

Often, the items available to bring you to the next set of resources are confusing or ineffective. As a staff member, when is the first row available to me in regards to academics at SU?

The information is slow and doesn't easily integrate with all of the other platforms we have to use.\n","WHY does MySlice default to the student view when I log in? I'm faculty, dangit. Always an extra click, and given the (lack of) speed of page load in MySlice, I'd hate to add up the extra time I spend every year just getting to the info and tools I need. We should be able to customize what we see and in what order when we log in.\n","Additionally, the tools within MySlice are not easy to use and don't have the information easily findable. For example, I just got an email about student religious exemptions that directed me to view religious exemptions by logging into MySlice and going to the faculty center. I'm looking at the faculty center and there's absolutely nothing about religious exemptions. I don't know if that means my students haven't filed any or if I'm looking in the wrong place or if the tool is broken or what.

The search function is good as there are a couple of things I can't figure out where they live.  Credit card reconciliation is nice that its all online and has a work flow but completing the form takes so much longer. Perhaps its a connectivity problem that I have to wait for every field of a chart string line.  At least in JPMC I could have a list of favorite chart string to choose from that would immediately populate the form.  I know ITS assists with Blackboard but as for Myslice I didn't know about help or support.  The role out of the new Myslice was terrible. Some prior communication could has softened the transition some (maybe).\n","Serious issue with student phone numbers not loading into Medicat properly, so if there is a mental health emergency we are unable to contact them by phone.  MySlice also has a known issue with updating address info.\n","There are many features controlled by multiple institutions such as HR or the registrar and not ITS, so ITS often replies that they can't help with an issue and you have to contact those other divisions and then the response time is very slow.\n","I can't find any of the applications or sub folders that I have access to.  It takes me longe to search and find them.  \n","As someone who prides themselves on being tech savvy, MySlice is not easy to navigate. I appreciate that, in some ways, the system allows for a lot of resources to be accessible through the MySlice channel, but MySlice is convoluted, slow, and unreliable.\n","Training modules/sessions that are easily accessible would be helpful.\n","Timeclock in myslice seems like an EOL software. Coming from my other job, there are a lot better systems out there for employee time tracking and payroll. It seems almost archaic as the GUI can be coded by any first-semester computer science student.\n","More help by phone versus many back and forth emails would be helpful\n","The lack of support in many areas of myslice when it comes to mobile browsers or anything non-chrome is depressing. The \"update\" done last year which was simply cosmetic ultimately seemed poorly thought out. \n","MySlice is confusing and difficult to use/understand.
