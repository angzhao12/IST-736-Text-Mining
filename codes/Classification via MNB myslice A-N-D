MySlice. It took some getting used to after the upgrade, but they have made some improvements to make it more user friendly. I do wish our purchasing portal and JPMC portals were upgraded or a new vendor chosen to handle it. It super clunky and hard to navigate sometimes.\n","Agree to Disagree errors: 1\n","Constantly getting timed out is frustrating as is switching from the Myslice student home page to the employee home page every time I sign on. The search function is good as there are a couple of things I can't figure out where they live.  Credit card reconciliation is nice that its all online and has a work flow but completing the form takes so much longer. Perhaps its a connectivity problem that I have to wait for every field of a chart string line.  At least in JPMC I could have a list of favorite chart string to choose from that would immediately populate the form.  I know ITS assists with Blackboard but as for Myslice I didn't know about help or support.  The role out of the new Myslice was terrible. Some prior communication could has softened the transition some (maybe).\n","E.g.: What is BFAS? Often, the items available to bring you to the next set of resources are confusing or ineffective. As a staff member, when is the first row available to me in regards to academics at SU? As a member of career services, how come I can't see resources available to my position or duties? Are there resources available to me (trainings, linkedin learning recommendations) regarding position type? What about non-traditional resources like housing or law clinics?\n","There are many features controlled by multiple institutions such as HR or the registrar and not ITS, so ITS often replies that they can't help with an issue and you have to contact those other divisions and then the response time is very slow.\n","I use My Slice daily, over 50% of the day for class management, student information, transcripts, and no problems with myslice, I think its great \n","The \"new\" interface is improved, but the information under the \"faculty and advisors\" tab makes me feel like I'm using a dial-up modem. The information is slow and doesn't easily integrate with all of the other platforms we have to use.\n","As someone who prides themselves on being tech savvy, MySlice is not easy to navigate. I appreciate that, in some ways, the system allows for a lot of resources to be accessible through the MySlice channel, but MySlice is convoluted, slow, and unreliable.\n","WHY does MySlice default to the student view when I log in? I'm faculty, dangit. Always an extra click, and given the (lack of) speed of page load in MySlice, I'd hate to add up the extra time I spend every year just getting to the info and tools I need. We should be able to customize what we see and in what order when we log in.\n","Additionally, the tools within MySlice are not easy to use and don't have the information easily findable. For example, I just got an email about student religious exemptions that directed me to view religious exemptions by logging into MySlice and going to the faculty center. I'm looking at the faculty center and there's absolutely nothing about religious exemptions. I don't know if that means my students haven't filed any or if I'm looking in the wrong place or if the tool is broken or what. That's just one example of many similar interactions I've experienced.\n","Training modules/sessions that are easily accessible would be helpful.\n","Just use Workday or other commercial solutions. It's not as good as they are. \n","I never receive communications regarding updates to MySlice\n","Disagree to Agree errors: 10\n"]}]},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["# Cross Validation"],"metadata":{"id":"Jl8yXm8pXSmw"}},{"cell_type":"code","source":["from sklearn.naive_bayes import BernoulliNB\n","from sklearn.naive_bayes import MultinomialNB\n","\n","from sklearn.pipeline import Pipeline\n","from sklearn.model_selection import cross_val_score\n","#unigram\n","nb_clf_pipe = Pipeline([('vect',  CountVectorizer(encoding='latin-1', binary=False)),('nb', MultinomialNB())])\n","scores = cross_val_score(nb_clf_pipe, X, y, cv=5)\n","avg=sum(scores)/len(scores)\n","print(\"unigram\",avg)\n","\n","#  boolean vectorizer\n","nb_clf_pipe = Pipeline([('vect', CountVectorizer(encoding='latin-1', binary=True)),('nb', MultinomialNB())])\n","scores = cross_val_score(nb_clf_pipe, X, y, cv=5)\n","avg=sum(scores)/len(scores)\n","print(\"boolean\",avg)\n","\n","#Bigram\n","nb_clf_pipe = Pipeline([('vect', CountVectorizer(encoding='latin-1', ngram_range=(2,2))),('nb', MultinomialNB())])\n","scores = cross_val_score(nb_clf_pipe, X, y, cv=5)\n","avg=sum(scores)/len(scores)\n","print(\"bigram\",avg)\n","\n","#  unigram and bigram \n","nb_clf_pipe = Pipeline([('vect',CountVectorizer(encoding='latin-1', ngram_range=(1,2))),('nb', MultinomialNB())])\n","scores = cross_val_score(nb_clf_pipe, X, y, cv=5)\n","avg=sum(scores)/len(scores)\n","print(\"unigram and bigram\",avg)\n","\n","#  unigram tfidf vectorizer\n","from sklearn.pipeline import Pipeline\n","from sklearn.model_selection import cross_val_score\n","nb_clf_pipe = Pipeline([('vect', TfidfVectorizer(encoding='latin-1', use_idf=True)),('nb', MultinomialNB())])\n","scores = cross_val_score(nb_clf_pipe, X, y, cv=5)\n","avg=sum(scores)/len(scores)\n","print(\"tf-idf\",avg)"],"metadata":{"id":"arwarTQgXMpk","colab":{"base_uri":"https://localhost:8080/"},"executionInfo":{"status":"ok","timestamp":1669678205251,"user_tz":300,"elapsed":959,"user":{"displayName":"A H","userId":"17305032561796366923"}},"outputId":"1bc6f3de-e96e-446a-d63c-4706e5176ad3"},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[{"output_type":"stream","name":"stdout","text":["unigram 0.6791666666666667\n","boolean 0.6833333333333333\n","bigram 0.6541666666666667\n","unigram and bigram 0.6895833333333332\n","tf-idf 0.6895833333333333\n"]}]}]}
