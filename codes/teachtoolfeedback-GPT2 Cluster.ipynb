I would prefer that this was a website that one could access when interested or an email letter that it is possible to opt-out of and not automatically sent.\n","ARE YOU FREAKING KIDDING ME? There's no mention of 2U on the list of platforms?! That explains why there's zero support. And NO, 2U does not provide adequate support. I'm livid.\n","The Answers page should either be streamlined and regularly maintained or removed, as it often creates more problems than it solves (with old info or contradictory advice across pages). \n","\n","\n","======cluster # 4 , cluster size: 11\n","I sometimes ask for help with Bb which I receive, but it's unclear to me what I am allowed to do in bb versus what only IT can do for me. I waste time trying to do something I cannot do and I waste the time of IT when asking about functionality I should be able to access.\n","Blackboard is not always easy to use and sometimes glitchy. And some of the functionality it's unclear who to go to for help. For example, posting a textbook purchase online through blackboard was highly problematic and I kept getting bounced between the bookstore and the textbook vendor. Never did get it to work quite right.\n","Of the three (Blackboard, Kaltura, and Google Suite), Kaltura seems the most challenging to use especially once the video is created.  I am never quite sure if I have completed all the steps prior to posting a video in Blackboard.  I also had trouble using the question integration feature.\n","I have heard of other universities switching from blackboard to other platforms such as bright space, but blackboard is working fine for me.  I'd much rather stay with blackboard; at least for me personally, changing systems in the name of \"progress\" would just incur a new learning curve and disrupt my workflow.\n","I wish that our graduate students had access to a suite of data tools, like SPSS, Nvivo, etc. These are available based on college/unit enrollment, which seems like a really inequitable way to go. For instance, students at Maxwell get these programs for free. Students at SOE have to pay out of pocket for them.\n","\n","\n","======cluster # 5 , cluster size: 16\n","I can't even imagine what went into converting the entire campus to digital learning during the pandemic, and really want to thank the IT professionals who took care of it. In general, I would prefer Canvas to Blackboard as a teaching software, believe we need a dedicated Jupyter Lab environment for teaching programming in ECS, and think the ECS OIT needs to rethink the AppsAnywhere virtualization platform for many engineering software. Software virtualization is not appropriate for programming IDEs, and any software that serves as a GUI for fortran, python, R, or similar mathematical models/simulations. We need more staff available to ensure that requested teaching software is actually accessible to our students, both in the classroom and at home, as of right now it is entirely on the instructor to ensure technical compatibility. Massive turnover in IT staff during the pandemic has severely impacted research computing workflows on campus.\n","The only reason I feel somewhat comfortable using blackboard is because of the ITS intensive SITL workshop. In my humble opinion, every SU instructor should be required to take it. It was so awesome!\n","\n","Blackboard is very capable, but hard to learn. The new Tiny rich text editor requires a training workshop. I am still scratching the surface in regards to automatically grading exercises.\n","\n","We are in the warehouse, support is far away. often times the connection of the real classroom and the online teaching is disconnected. (bad displays/projectors, bad audio  (poor microphone), bad video (poor webcam)\n","\n","e.g. steps needed to include a sketch on the physical whiteboard on Blackboard: \n","without any editing\n","1] take a picture with my personal smartphone\n","2] upload to cloud\n","3] download on SU computer\n","4] upload to blackboard\n","5] resize in Tiny rich text editor \n","I feel that there are new teaching technology tools that exist out there but we are not aware of them. We don't know what we don't know. Sometimes I accidentally learn from colleagues or someone from IT about certain tools that exist for faculty but we never were informed of them and never had workshops. I would like Central IT (OLS) to hold college-by-college training (1-2 hours) at the beginning of every fall semester to inform us of new teaching technology and tools that are useful in teaching (related to student engagement, like Kahoot, video capturing and sharing, etc etc). Basically, a super short version of SITETL. I am a SITETL alum and I benefited so much from that summer a few years ago. I wish it was \"scalable\" and available to more faculty. Thank you.\n","I rely on Google drive, blackboard and Kaltura the most on this list and cannot imagine teaching without them. If there was more integration between google drive and blackboard, that would be useful. Like turning video assignments in on Google drive if they could be linked to turning in the assignment on blackboard somehow. Right now it’s a 2 step process. Also the Zoom recording to Kaltura for editing and storage is a lifesaver. All positives here!!\n","I'm surprised that students are not familiar with responding within online teaching tools. They are not as tech-savvy as I thought - they only know how to access social media for the most part, and don't have familiarity with LMS, or even designing spreadsheets, word documents, etc. I think an online module should be created when students register for a class, explaining what tools that they would use and the capacity of the operating system that they will need, etc.\n","\n","\n","======cluster # 6 , cluster size: 5\n","I have had some unique challenges with playposit, kaltura and blackboard.
