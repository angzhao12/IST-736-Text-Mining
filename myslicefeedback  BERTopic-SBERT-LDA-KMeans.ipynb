Constantly shuts down or logs you out once you get to the section you want. And don't get me started on the things that are *not* there. Like why can't I see how many hours/how much money my students have worked? \n","It was a lot easier to find my way around, not to mention explain to other people how to find things, when the breadcrumbs were still available. Also, the new icons are confusing - the names associated with them often don't express very well what you can find there. \n","\n","\n","======cluster # 4\n","Basic \n"," \n","N\n","The biggest issue is that my ability to access MySlice in various browsers with various settings has been inconsistent in the past few years. There have been times when I have to start a less secure browser in order to get it to load properly. My preferred browser uses a pretty strict selective script blocker, and so it is helpful to know precisely what domains I need to whitelist, and that becomes hard when the page has many layers of requests, each conditional on the last being successfully executed. Right now, though, it seems to work fine.\n","  \n","Separately (or perhaps related), the new layout with the large tiles is sort of annoying -- I used to be able to use my browser's text search function to quickly find the tools I needed, since they were all listed in plain text on a single web page. Now I have to either remember which section they are in or use MySlice's built-in search tool, which of course cannot possibly be as streamlined as a simple browser text search. That said, MySlice probably shouldn't be designed around the needs of someone like me who is highly tech-savvy -- I will be able to find what I need one way or another. Maybe the tiles make it easier for some people.\n","New \"updates\" to myslice have made it much worse, not better.

purposes. That said, it is frustratingly slow to load pages to look up data especially looking up PeopleSoft/HRSA content. I also find that I am not able to use concurrent PeopleSoft/HRSA tabs- each with different content- on my browser to compare the different PS content areas and take advantage of multiple monitors. Multiple tabs revert to the last open tab. Also, MySlice content is organized by tiles within tabs; as an applicant/employee/student there's a ton of overlap across the 3 separate pages for each of my roles yet it's not clear how much commonality there is underneath each tile in each role. For efficiency, can't we have one page with all tiles?\n","I use MySlice multiple times a day to access the campus resources I use most.\n","I do not find Myslice as intuitive to use as it was in the past.\n","\n","\n","======cluster # 3\n","I find the menus and functionality of MySlice work well, but currently there is what seems a needless double layering of options - some outside of a category called \"employee resources\" and others inside of it.

It's not clear who I would go to for help. MySlice regularly denies me access to certain areas and tells me to log out or that I have a \"stale request.\" Even when I log out and restart my computer, it gives me the same error message. To approve payroll, it can take me half an hour of trying to get MySlice to allow me access before I can get to the appropriate screen without being told to log off or that I have a stale request. Frustrating. Also, Orange Success and DegreeWorks work well but the Navigator function is hard to manuever and I can't find anything. That area needs some help to make it more user friendly.\n","The connection to Orange Success needs to be updated. I should not have to log in twice to get there from MySlice.\n","Only complaint is that I almost always have to log in twice when using myslice to approve time reports.

IT services are beyond helpful. MySlice and the PeopleSoft platform are challenging at best.\n","\n","\n","======cluster # 6\n","Lipstick on a pig. You can't just make tiles and call that an improvement to a system... \n","\n","You've gated a linktree that does nothing but link to outdated platforms that are unsupported by modern technology and browsers. You then force EVERYONE through the MySlice gate just to be frustrated with access to MySlice when really what the user needs is to go directly to Parchment for transcripts or to Answers for information or the parking or housing... those things are not \"in\" MySlice. The links are gatekept there. \"Security\" by locking a door without ACTUAL reformation is kind of sad, no?\n","It is hard to find things on MySlice.\n","It’s so hard to find things in MySlice (like parking).\n","\n","\n","======cluster # 7\n","The biggest issue is that my ability to access MySlice in various browsers with various settings has been inconsistent in the past few years. There have been times when I have to start a less secure browser in order to get it to load properly. My preferred browser uses a pretty strict selective script blocker, and so it is helpful to know precisely what domains I need to whitelist, and that becomes hard when the page has many layers of requests, each conditional on the last being successfully executed. Right now, though, it seems to work fine.\n","  \n","Separately (or perhaps related), the new layout with the large tiles is sort of annoying -- I used to be able to use my browser's text search function to quickly find the tools I needed, since they were all listed in plain text on a single web page. Now I have to either remember which section they are in or use MySlice's built-in search tool, which of course cannot possibly be as streamlined as a simple browser text search. That said, MySlice probably shouldn't be designed around the needs of someone like me who is highly tech-savvy -- I will be able to find what I need one way or another. Maybe the tiles make it easier for some people.\n","The MySlice platform has vastly improved for ease of use over the past two years. The tiles were a bit difficult at first to know where to start, and go next. Now I am more comfortable with the five primary tiles I need to use for my role.\n","MySlice does not work as well since last upgrade. Hard to find things and often get errors after login. Sometimes need to restart browser to get it to connect even if access to other SU sites/software is fine. \n"]}]},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["#

Once they finally get it right, if they do, they get a stale request curveball thrown at them. The standard bs answer you get from support is, \"open a new tab and try myslice again.\"  Again...solve the problem?\n","often have problems logging on (get error message \"you have logged out of MySlice\") even after getting into an application.\n","\n","\n","======cluster # 6\n","It's clunky, and just won't work at random times. I'll try to input my hours and it will just keep logging me out. The new interface makes it difficult to find information without clicking within multiple options to find something.\n","The two-factor authentication is really buggy. I constantly have to clear my cookies on the browser and/or \"go incognito\" to get it to work.\n","Navigation can be a bit annoying, the most aggravating thing s having to constantly log in even if I am going ti the same spot on the same day withina shrt period of time.\n","\n","\n","======cluster # 7\n","MySlice is difficult to navigate and very difficult to read. The course names and semester dates are nearly invisible. I also find it very difficult to advise students because I do not have access to student screens. Every single semester the information  posted is incorrect. I don't know if this has to do with our admin. assistant or the system but I have to relate  correction, changes, etc. every semester the classes are posted. MySlice doesn't seem intuitive to me. \n","It is frustrating that MySlice defaults to Student home and that you can't change it to default to Faculty home. Also, there are some bits of information that are buried in places that are hard to find.\n","I tried to enroll in a class, so ended up having a \"student\" MySlice too. It always sends me to that one rather than the faculty one. \n","The interface is not intuitive, and the CTA buttons once inside the different sections are not evident. \n","\n","\n","======cluster # 8\n","Can be difficult to find certain pieces of information especially within the time/payroll tab\n","I am grateful for having a \"one-stop-shop\" for all my employee needs.  It makes updating and retrieving information a lot easier.\n","I don't really remember many updates. For payroll related items, I have been very happy with it. For trainings or required activities, it's sometimes been difficult to find what I need.\n"]}]}]}
